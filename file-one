The Tempest

Act 2 - Scene 1

Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Gonzalo, Adrian,
Francisco, and others.

GONZALO, to Alonso 
Beseech you, sir, be merry. You have cause—
So have we all—of joy, for our escape
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is common; every day some sailor’s wife,
The masters of some merchant, and the merchant
Have just our theme of woe. But for the miracle—
I mean our preservation—few in millions
Can speak like us. Then wisely, good sir, weigh
Our sorrow with our comfort.
ALONSO  Prithee, peace.
SEBASTIAN, aside to Antonio  He receives comfort like
cold porridge.
ANTONIO  The visitor will not give him o’er so.
SEBASTIAN  Look, he’s winding up the watch of his wit.
By and by it will strike.
GONZALO, to Alonso  Sir—
SEBASTIAN  One. Tell.
GONZALO  When every grief is entertained that’s offered,
comes to th’ entertainer—
SEBASTIAN  A dollar.
GONZALO  Dolor comes to him indeed. You have spoken
truer than you purposed.
SEBASTIAN  You have taken it wiselier than I meant you
should.
GONZALO, to Alonso  Therefore, my lord—
ANTONIO  Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue.
ALONSO, to Gonzalo  I prithee, spare.
GONZALO  Well, I have done. But yet—
SEBASTIAN, aside to Antonio  He will be talking.
ANTONIO, aside to Sebastian  Which, of he or Adrian,
for a good wager, first begins to crow?
SEBASTIAN  The old cock.
ANTONIO  The cockerel.
SEBASTIAN  Done. The wager?
ANTONIO  A laughter.
SEBASTIAN  A match!
ADRIAN  Though this island seem to be desert—
ANTONIO  Ha, ha, ha.
SEBASTIAN  So. You’re paid.
ADRIAN  Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible—
SEBASTIAN  Yet—
ADRIAN  Yet—
ANTONIO  He could not miss ’t.
ADRIAN  It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate
temperance.
ANTONIO  Temperance was a delicate wench.
SEBASTIAN  Ay, and a subtle, as he most learnedly
delivered.
ADRIAN  The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
SEBASTIAN  As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.
ANTONIO  Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen.
GONZALO  Here is everything advantageous to life.
ANTONIO  True, save means to live.
SEBASTIAN  Of that there’s none, or little.
GONZALO  How lush and lusty the grass looks! How
green!
ANTONIO  The ground indeed is tawny.
SEBASTIAN  With an eye of green in ’t.
